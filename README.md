# fzz [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrnugget/fzz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrnugget/fzz)

**Do one thing, do it well â€” multiple times!**

**fzz** allows you to change the input of a single command interactively. Have a
look and pay close attention to the bee's knees here:

## Installation

Current version: 1.0.1

### Download the binaries

Download the [current release](https://github.com/mrnugget/fzz/releases) for
your platform and copy the **fzz** binary to your `$PATH`.

### Compile from source

Make sure you have Go installed. Then install **fzz** from source:

```
go get github.com/mrnugget/fzz
```

## Usage

The general usage pattern is this:

```bash
fzz [command with {{}} placeholder]
```

Example: using **fzz** and `grep` to search through all `*.go` files in the current
directory.

```
fzz grep {{}} *.go
```

Running this presents you with a prompt that allows you to change what `grep`
will use as its search pattern by replacing `{{}}`.

After every input change **fzz** will rerun `grep` with the new input and
show you what `grep` wrote to its STDOUT or, hopefully not, to its STDERR.

Once you're happy with the presented results simply press **return** to quit
**fzz** and have the results printed to STDOUT.

Since the results will be printed to STDOUT you can use **fzz** with pipes:

```
fzz grep {{}} *.go | head -n 1 | awk -F":" '{print $1}'
```

**fzz** buffers its STDIN and passes it on to the specified command. That means
you can put pipes all around it:

```
grep 'func' *.go | fzz grep {{}} | head -n 1
```

If you want to change the placeholder, you can do that by specifying it with the
environment variable `FZZ_PLACEHOLDER`:

```
FZZ_PLACEHOLDER=%% fzz grep %% *.go
```

## Usage Examples

### Searching with ag

Use **fzz** to search through your current directory with
[the_silver_searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)
interactively:

```
fzz ag {{}}
```

### fzz and find for interactive file search

We can combine `find` and `fzz` to interactively search for files that match our
input pattern:

```
fzz find ./Documents -iname "*{{}}*"
```

### Use it in Vim to grep through your project

Use it as interactive project search in vim

```
:set grepprg=fzz\ ag\ \{\{\}\}
```

Then use `:grep` in Vim to start it. **fzz** will then fill the quickfix window
with its results.

Or use the placeholder Vim provides to set the initial input of fzz:

```
set grepprg=fzz\ ag\ --nogroup\ --nocolor\ \{\{\$*}\}
```

Then you can use `:grep mysearchterm`, see the results and refine them if
necessary.

### Interactively search files and open the results in your editor

Put this in your shell config and configure it to use your favorite editor:

```bash
vimfzz() {
  vim $(fzz ag {{}} | awk -F":" '{print $1}' | uniq)
}
```

## TODO

* Man page
* Maybe change how fzz is printing its output to the TTY: instead of clearing the
  screen, jump to the first line, right after the input and rewrite the visible
  lines (padded so that all the columns are used and the previous output is not
  visible anymore)
* Maybe selection of a line with Ctrl-J and Ctrl-K and the only print the
  selected line.
